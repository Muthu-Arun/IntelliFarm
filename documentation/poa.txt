PLAN OF ACTION

->  Making the physical model to get real time weather data to feed the AI model

->  Building the RESTAPI backend with a C++ framework for maximum performance and tight integration with AI tools

->  A python backend for Data Analytics Tasks

->  Nginx as load balencer and to serve static files for the website

->  The physical model sends realtime weather data to the backend server which consists of pre-trained AI models to predict various aspects of Agriculture sector

-> The farmer has access to all the information

->  There is plan to implement autonomous BOTs to help in the farming process however that's beyond the scope of this project

->  The AI models will be able to predict market prices or price crashes beforehand and also weather and advice farmers accordingly

->  We present this as a solution for encountering the inefficiencies in the agriculture sector

-> Plans to implement percision farming techniques in the future
